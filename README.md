# Quick Draw GAN

In this project I implemented and trained a DCGAN model on the [Google Quick, Draw! dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). The GAN is able to generate 28x28 images resembling drawings made by people.

## Sources

The model was trained using dataset provided by Google: [Google Quick, Draw! dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).

The model is based on the DCGAN as proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434v1).
